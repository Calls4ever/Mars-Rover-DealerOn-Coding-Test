# Mars-Rover-DealerOn-Coding-Test

This web app will let us to control movements and direction of rover (triangular shape in the canvas) over the defined area. One can use 'r' or 'R' to turn right, or 'l' or 'L' to turn left and 'm' or 'M' to move towards inteded direction. And we can use 'enter' to print the output, the coordinates of the rover on the screen.

I initially tried to code in `Typescript` but i am more confortable with `Javascript` so i used javascript, HTML, and CSS to make the programme more visualized.
